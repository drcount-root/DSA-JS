Problem Description
Tesla is testing their new car which they will be launching soon. The driver of the car started recording the speed of the car. Letâ€™s assume he always starts with a speed of 1500. Whenever his speed changed, he recorded this change in an array. This array is given to you as input. You have to return a result array with two numbers - the highest speed he ever reached and his final speed.


Input format
First line contains an integer n.

Second line contains n space separated integers.


Output format
Return an array with 2 integers


Sample Input 1
5

100 -200 350 100 -600


Sample Output 1
1850 1250


Explanation
Initial speed is always 1500.

1500+100=1600

1600-200=1400

1400+350=1750

1750+100=1850

1850-600=1250

Among these speeds, his highest speed is 1850 and the final speed is 1250.


Constraints
1<=n<=100000

-1000<=diffs[i]<=1000
*/

function tesla(diffs, n) {
  const initial_speed = 1500;
  const changedSpeedArr = [];

  changedSpeedArr.push(initial_speed + diffs[0]);
  for (let i = 1; i < n; i++) {
    changedSpeedArr.push(changedSpeedArr[i - 1] + diffs[i]);
  }
  return [Math.max(...changedSpeedArr), changedSpeedArr[n - 1]];
}

console.log(tesla([100, -200, 350, 100, -600], 5));
